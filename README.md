# Data Structures

## B-Tree
A **B-Tree** is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. It is commonly used in databases and file systems for efficient indexing of large amounts of data.

### Key Properties:
- The tree is balanced and maintains sorted keys.
- It allows efficient search, insertion, and deletion in logarithmic time.
- Used in scenarios like database indexing and file systems (e.g., MySQL, NTFS).

## Graph
A **Graph** is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. It can be either directed or undirected. Graphs are used in various applications like social networks, network routing, and web page linking.

### Key Concepts:
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores the graph layer by layer, starting from the given node.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Min-Heap
A **Min-Heap** is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, where the parent node is smaller than or equal to its children. It is often used for priority queues, Dijkstra's algorithm, and heapsort.

### Key Properties:
- The root node is always the minimum element.
- Insertion and extraction of the minimum element are efficient, both in logarithmic time.
- Used for implementing priority queues and sorting algorithms.

## Linked List
A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists provide flexibility in insertion and deletion of elements, though they have slower access times compared to arrays.

### Key Properties:
- Each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
- Dynamic in size, allowing efficient insertion and deletion operations.
- Slower element access compared to arrays because traversal is required.

## Queue
A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. It is used in scenarios like scheduling tasks, handling requests, and buffering.

### Key Properties:
- Follows the FIFO principle: the first element added is the first to be removed.
- Efficient for scenarios where elements need to be processed in the order they arrive.

---

## Stack
A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. It is used in applications such as function calls, undo mechanisms, and parsing expressions.

### Key Properties:
- Follows the LIFO principle: the last element added is the first to be removed.
- Ideal for recursive operations, backtracking algorithms, and storing temporary data.

---

## Tree
A **Tree** is a hierarchical data structure with a root element and sub-elements that form a parent-child relationship. It is used in various applications like file systems, databases, and decision-making processes.

### Key Properties:
- Nodes are connected by edges in a hierarchical structure.
- Often used to represent hierarchical data such as organizational charts or directory structures.
- Traversal can be done in various ways, like Pre-order, In-order, or Post-order.
